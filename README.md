# Max's Data & Engineering Projects

Hello everyone! 👋

My name is Max. I am an Data Engineer focused on designing and optimizing data solutions that empower teams to make strategic decisions. My expertise lies in developing scalable data models, automating processes, and ensuring data quality, with a strong background in SQL, data pipelines, and Python for automation and transformation.

My career has been a journey from business operations to technical roles in data engineering, and I am passionate about continuous learning, especially around cloud infrastructure and data architecture.

This repository is part of my effort to keep learning and trying new things, in this project I use TypeScript and other technologies, researching heavily
